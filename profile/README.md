# Welcome to the `rednote-hilab` Family

## Introduction
Founded in Shanghai in 2013, rednote is a platform where users capture and share their lives through photos, text, videos, and live streams, building an interactive community around shared interests. Guided by its mission to *Inspire Lives*, rednote is becoming a vibrant hub for diverse lifestyles and a trusted companion to millions. The rednote hilab team — where “hi” stands for *humane intelligence* — is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI by creating more diverse and balanced forms of intelligence, such as interpersonal, spatial-visual, and musical intelligence and more. Our ultimate goal is to make AI a truly natural and beneficial companion to humanity.

## Research
* [dots.llm1](https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.llm1/blob/main/dots1_tech_report.pdf) We released (i) checkpoints for state-of-the-art medium-sized models and (ii) training recipes for the MoE models.
* [dots.ocr](https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr) is a powerful, multilingual document parser that unifies layout detection and content recognition within a single vision-language model while maintaining good reading order. Despite its compact 1.7B-parameter LLM foundation, it achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance.
